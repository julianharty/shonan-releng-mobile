## Discussion 

* Many open questions:
	* Do developers have different technical concerns?
	* Have the stakeholders changed?
	* What is mobile?
		* Is it something with limited hardware, or bandwidth?
		* Or is a laptop a mobile device?

* Clear challenges:
	* Gate keeper
	* Deployment
	* Feedback

* The future is the convergence!
	* Desktops will adopt a lot of the ideas from the mobile world
	* The differences will get smaller and smalle

## Next steps

What do researchers need to explore, in order to clarify the
similarities/differences among mobile release engineering vs
non-mobile release engineering:

* In one dimension:
	* Package manager
	* App store (mobile)
	* App store (non mobile, e.g., Steam)
* In another dimension:
	* Stakeholders (users and devs)
	* Pipeline (control gatekeeper, speed, frequency)
	* Feedback (issue tracking)
	* Economics (revenue/models, market share, exclusivity)
