# What Makes Mobile Special for Releng?

There are two release engineering based challenges
* **Approval/Post-approval**: Centralized app stores (gate keepers) Not necessarily mobile
* **Pre-approval**: Different mobile device fragmentation based challenges (for development and testing)

## Approval/ post-apporval challenges

* Shares challenges with other gate-keeper based eco systems
    * steam game store, atlassian appstore etc
* Not only technical issues. Soical/economical challenges

## Pre-approval challenges

* Development is done in a different machine from the one it's deployed
* Fragemented by different OSes, hardware, testing challenges
