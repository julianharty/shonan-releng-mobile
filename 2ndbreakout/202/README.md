# What Makes Mobile Special for Releng?

Lines are blurry about what is a mobile device. 
* Is a chromebook with android apps a mobile device?
* Is it a device designed for mobility?
* Is it a device with limited hardware?
Even defining what's mobile is a challenging topic.

Then we narrow down on two dimensions on release engineering challenges for mobile.
* **Approval/Post-approval**: Centralized app stores (gate keepers) Not necessarily mobile
* **Pre-approval**: Different mobile device fragmentation based challenges (for development and testing)

## Approval/ post-apporval challenges

* Shares challenges with other gate-keeper based eco systems
    * steam game store, atlassian appstore etc
* Not only technical issues. Soical/economical/policy challenges
* Multiple gate keepers (company + government)
* Different customer bases
* How to make more money? recurring subscription or one time (different business models)
* How to make users install/updates

## Pre-approval challenges

* Development is done in a different machine from the one it's deployed
* Fragmented by different OSes, hardware, testing challenges (runtime)
* Variants in devices
* Testing for low bandwidth / limited hardware
* **But main challenge: As researchers, we don't really know what's happening here. (we don't have access to this information)**
