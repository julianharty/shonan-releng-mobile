# Human Aspects of Release Engineering/Mobile Apps

Release engineering is not about bug fixes, but it's about social contract / interactions between users and developers.
We break users into 2 types, i.e., new users and existing users.
Are we in the age of release economics? We try to release apps to get more money ($$$), get more users, and chage users' behaviors.
For example, we are about to release a new version with bug fixes and updates but don't forget to pay $5.
So, we hypothesize that users can change release engineering, and release engineering can change users' behaviors.

Q1: How do users accept releases (1st release for new users and later for existing users)? is it based on automatically updates? 

Q2: How do developers positively and negatively change the users' behaviors.

Q3: How do app stores / ecosystems allow dev/users to accept releases?

Implications/Benefits: win-win strategies for both users and developers + anti-patterns in release engienering.

Other questions:

- Why mobile apps do not use issue tracking systems? Why do App stores do not provide ITSs for users?

- Do developers care about bugs?

- How do users accept releases?

- Do users care about security? What would users do or take to care about security? What are security-critical apps? (not all apps/users need to care about security) 

- Do different app stores have different users' expectation / users' behaviors? (games have high reviews than educational app reviews)

- Why do the same apps but in different stores have different price?

- Do users from different app stores have different expectation/behaviors?
