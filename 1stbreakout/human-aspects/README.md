# Human Aspects of Release Engineering/Mobile Apps

Release engineering is not about bug fixes, but it's about social contact/interactions.
We assert that users can change release engineering, and release engineering can change users' behaviors.

Q1: How do users accept releases (1st release for new users and later for retaining users)?

Q2: How do developers positively and negatively change the users' behaviors.

Q3: How do app store / ecosystems allow dev/users to accept releases?
