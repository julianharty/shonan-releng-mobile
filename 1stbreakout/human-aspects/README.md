# Human Aspects of Release Engineering/Mobile Apps

Release engineering is not about bug fixes, but it's about social interactions.
Are we in the age of release economics? We try to release apps to get more money ($$$), get more users, and chage users' behaviors.
For example, we are about to release a new version with bug fixes and updates but don't forget to pay $5.
So, we hypothesize that users can change release engineering, and release engineering can change users' behaviors.

Q1: How do users accept releases (1st release for new users and later for retaining users)?

Q2: How do developers positively and negatively change the users' behaviors.

Q3: How do app store / ecosystems allow dev/users to accept releases?

Implications/Benefits: win-win strategies for both users and developers + anti-patterns in release engienering.

Other questions:

- Why mobile apps do not use issue tracking systems?

- Do developers care about bugs?

- How do users accept releases?

- Do users care about security?

- Do different app stores have different expectation?

- Why do the same apps but in different stores have different price?

- Do users from different app stores have different expectation/behaviors?
