# Continuous Experimentation for Mobile

## Continuous Experimentation
- `whether you built the right thing (validation)`
- *Testing:* whether you built the thing right (verification)

## Processes
- A/B Testing
- Canary Releases
- Dark launches

## Mechanisms
- Blue/Green
- Feature toggles
- Alpha users

## State-of-the-art
- Third-party libraries
- App store support (i.e., location based releases)

## Challenges
1. How to do all these mechanisms in Mobile App?
2. Are the processes mapping reviews+metrics to the deployed version?
3. Because there is no native support (by gatekeeper), can third-parties be trusted?
4. How to architect for allowing dynamic views?
5. How to effectively use feature toggles with the App stores (gatekeepers)?
6. What are the challenges to collecting telemetry?
7. Continuous experimentation for the ~~losers~~masses?
8. How to do rollbacks with the App stores control?

## Other challenges
- Deploying hot fixes
