## Continuous Experimentation
- `whether you built the right thing (validation)`
- *Testing:* whether you built the thing right (verification)

## Processes
- A/B Testing
- Canary Releases
- Dark launches

## Mechanisms
- Blue/Green
- Feature toggles
- Alpha users

## State-of-the-art
- Third-party libraries
- App store (i.e., gatekeepers) support (i.e., location based releases)

## Challenges
1. How to do all these mechanisms in Mobile App?
2. Because there is no native support (by gatekeeper), can third-parties or gatekeeper be trusted, and what information needs?
3. Can micro-transactions (by gatekeeper) be used for continuous experimentation?
4. Are the processes mapping reviews+metrics to the deployed version?
5. How to architect for allowing dynamic views?
6. How to effectively use feature toggles with gatekeepers?
7. What are the challenges to collecting telemetry?
8. Continuous experimentation for the ~~losers~~masses?
9. How to do rollbacks with gatekeeper control?

## Other challenges
- Deploying hot fixes
