## Continuous Experimentation
- whether you built the right thing (validation)
- Testing: whether you built the thing right (verification)

## Processes
- A/B Testing
- Canary Releases
- Dark launches

## Mechanisms
- Blue/Green
- Feature toggles
- Alpha users

## Challenges
- How to do all these mechanisms in Mobile App?
- Are the processes mapping reviews+metrics to the deployed version?
- Because there is no native support (by gatekeeper), can third-parties be trusted?
- How to architect for allowing dynamic views?
- What are the challenges to collecting telemetry?
- Continuous experimentation for the masses?

## Other challenges
- Deploying hot fixes

### Other other
masses are the losers!
