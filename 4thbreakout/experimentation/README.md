# Goals

We define the main goal of understanding the extended of Continuous Experimentation practices in mobile development.

# Proposal

Because of the lack of understanding of the state of practice in Continuous Experimentation among mobile developers we propose a mixed method study with a qualitative study about the practices of developers about CE. This study will provide insights on the level of maturity of the CE process, the limitations developers face and what kind of tooling they are using to solve the problems in CE.

We see three different populations:
- Developers who are not doing anything
- Developers who are doing basic monitoring using native features, alpha/beta users
- Developers who are doing CE

From these three populations we want to obtain the following information:

- How do you get feedback about design/technical effects of your releases? (app store reviews/social media channels/in-app metrics)
- What is your release strategy?
  - Do you use a pre-release channel?
  - How do you decide to promote pre-releases to releases?
  - How  and when do you rollback? (ANRs/crashes? Bug reports?)
  - What are you monitoring/paying attention to?
- This is continuous experimentation in theory. [...]
  - Do you think your organization is doing this in some way?
  - Do you think CE could be desirable for you?
  - If not, why?
  - If yes, â€¦
    - What tools are you using?
    - What are the limitations in current tools?
    - What particular techniques are you using? (A/B testing, blue-green, canary etc.)
    - What type of features you are experimenting on?
    - Do you use CE in specific parts of your system and does the results of such experiments influence your decisions on the development of your mobile application?

From the information from the qualitative study we propose a quantitative study that explores the practices used by the developers in the wild. This study depends on the information obtained from the quantitative study and because of that is not as mature now.
